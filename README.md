## Getting started: 
* clone this repo. 
* From a terminal, run
 ```
 python app.py
 ```
then open your browser and go to 127.0.0.1:5000

### Prerequisites: 
* Flask
* Python


## Description:

#### Load files
The UI enables reading an image with its openpose detection output (.json). 
Once the image file and JSON file is loaded, the tool plots a point each keyjoint. 
* To see more information about each keypoint, you can use hover with your mouse. 
* You can select a keypoint and move it around. 
* You see the selected keypoint ID and confidence at the status box. 
* You can change the confidence of a selected keypoint by pressing ("+" or "c") keys to increase it by 20% every time you press. You can also decrease a keypoint confidence by pressing ("-" or "d") keys to decrease a keypoint confidence by 20%.

#### View options
* View options can choose to hide some keypoints.
* These keypoints are divided as they are in openpose. 
* There are skeleton keypoints, face keypoints, and (left, right) hand keypoints.

#### Search a keypoint
You can also search for a keypoint in using its id. A keypoint id is defined by the person_id, category id, keypoint number. 
* The person id can be found by hover the mouse on another keypoint of that person. 
* The keypoint category id is one of [0: skeleton, 1: face, 2: left hand, 3: right hand].
* The keypoint id can be recovered from the reference images in the top. 

#### Delete a keypoint
* You can also delete a keypoint by clicking on it then pressing DEL or Backspace. 
* Deleting a keypoint sets it to (0, 0) position with confidence 0%.


#### Save new JSON
* After you finish correcting your keypoints, you can save a new JSON file with the new keypoints. 
* The file will be named with a postfix "_corrected.json"
